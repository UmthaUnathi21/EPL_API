        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <section>
            <p>This website was inspired by my passion for sports and the desire to represent sports data visually. As a basketball athlete and a fan of sports analytics, I have always been fascinated by how numbers can tell a story. This project represents my efforts to combine my love for sports with web development and data visualization. The chart on the EFL page provides a detailed view of the performance of Premier League teams, and itâ€™s just one example of how data can make a significant impact on sports analysis.</p>
